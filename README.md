## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Data Collection, Exploration, and Preprocessing
- Collect datasets (e.g., LFW, VGGFace) ensuring diversity.
- Analyze dataset distribution, quality, and biases.
- Preprocess images: resizing, normalization, face detection, and augmentation.
- **Deliverables:** Dataset Exploration Report, Preprocessed Data.

### Milestone 2: Facial Recognition Model Development
- Select a model (FaceNet, VGG-Face, DeepFace, or custom CNN).
- Train and fine-tune using transfer learning.
- Evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and False Acceptance Rate (FAR).
- **Deliverables:** Model Evaluation Report, Final Model.

### Milestone 3: Deployment and Real-Time Testing
- Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI.
- Integrate with live video streams for real-time recognition.
- Test system under different lighting, angles, and expressions.
- **Deliverables:** Deployed Model, Testing Report.

### Milestone 4: MLOps and Monitoring
- Implement MLOps with MLflow/Kubeflow.
- Set up continuous monitoring for performance tracking.
- Automate model retraining on performance degradation.
- **Deliverables:** MLOps Report, Monitoring Setup.

### Milestone 5: Final Documentation and Presentation
- Document entire project workflow, challenges, and solutions.
- Prepare a final presentation covering architecture, applications, and learnings.
- **Deliverables:** Final Project Report, Final Presentation.
